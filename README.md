The goal of the **xgofind** project is to create a flexible and efficient HTTP interceptor proxy that enables real-time inspection, modification, and manipulation of HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This tool primarily aims to assist security 
professionals, developers, and researchers in tasks such as:

### Security Testing (Pentesting):

Inspect and modify requests and responses to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
Simulate attacks like header injections, payload manipulation, and authentication testing.

### Application Development and Debugging:

Monitor traffic between clients and servers to understand API and web application behavior.
Test request modifications without altering client or server code.

### Education and Research:

Provide a practical tool for understanding HTTP/HTTPS protocols and web traffic mechanics.
Demonstrate traffic interception techniques in a controlled environment.

### Customizable Flexibility:

Enable the extension of the proxy with new features, such as detailed logging, header injection, or custom traffic manipulation rules.

The xgofind project is designed to be simple, modular, and open-source, allowing users to adapt the tool to their specific needs. It also serves as an educational project for exploring Goâ€™s capabilities in building network-based applications.
